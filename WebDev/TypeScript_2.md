# TypeScript Interfaces

In TypeScript, **interfaces** are used to define the structure of an object, including the types of its properties and methods. Interfaces allow you to define complex types that can enforce a contract on the objects that implement them.

## 1. What is an Interface in TypeScript?

An **interface** in TypeScript is a syntactical contract that defines the shape of an object, including the types of its properties and methods. Interfaces are used to ensure that a class or an object adheres to a specific structure.

### Key Features of Interfaces:
- Can define the types of properties and methods for an object.
- Can be implemented by classes or used to type-check objects.
- Can extend other interfaces to inherit properties.
- Can be used with functions, arrays, and other structures.

## 2. Defining an Interface

In TypeScript, you define an interface using the `interface` keyword followed by the name of the interface. The body of the interface consists of the properties or methods you expect the object to have.

### Syntax:

```typescript
interface InterfaceName {
  property1: type;
  property2: type;
  method1(param: type): returnType;
}
```

### Example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  greet(): void;
}
```

In this example, the `Person` interface has:
- A `name` property of type `string`.
- An `age` property of type `number`.
- A `greet` method that returns `void` (no return value).

## 3. Using Interfaces with Objects

You can use interfaces to type-check objects. When an object is created, TypeScript will ensure that it adheres to the structure defined by the interface.

### Example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  greet(): void;
}

const person: Person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}.`);
  }
};

person.greet();  // Output: Hello, my name is John.
```

In this example, the object `person` adheres to the `Person` interface and implements the `greet` method.

## 4. Optional Properties in Interfaces

Sometimes, not all properties are required. You can make a property optional by using the `?` symbol.

### Syntax:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age?: number;  // age is optional
  greet(): void;
}
```

### Example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age?: number;  // age is optional
  greet(): void;
}

const person1: Person = {
  name: "John",
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};

const person2: Person = {
  name: "Jane",
  age: 25,
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello, I am Jane!");
  }
};
```

In this example, `age` is optional in the `Person` interface, so `person1` can omit it.

## 5. Readonly Properties

You can make properties of an interface **readonly** by using the `readonly` modifier. This ensures that the property cannot be modified after it is initialized.

### Syntax:

```typescript
interface Person {
  readonly name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

### Example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  readonly name: string;
  age: number;
}

const person: Person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

person.name = "Jane";  // Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
```

In this example, `name` is a readonly property, so it cannot be reassigned after initialization.

## 6. Function Types in Interfaces

You can use interfaces to define the type of a function, including the parameters and return type.

### Syntax:

```typescript
interface FunctionInterface {
  (param1: type, param2: type): returnType;
}
```

### Example:

```typescript
interface AddFunction {
  (a: number, b: number): number;
}

const add: AddFunction = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(5, 3));  // Output: 8
```

In this example, the `AddFunction` interface defines a function type that takes two `number` parameters and returns a `number`.

## 7. Extending Interfaces

You can extend interfaces to create new interfaces that inherit the properties and methods of one or more existing interfaces.

### Syntax:

```typescript
interface ChildInterface extends ParentInterface {
  newProperty: type;
}
```

### Example:

```typescript
interface Animal {
  name: string;
  sound(): void;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
}

const dog: Dog = {
  name: "Max",
  breed: "Labrador",
  sound() {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
};
```

In this example, the `Dog` interface extends the `Animal` interface, inheriting its properties and methods, while adding a new property `breed`.

## 8. Interface with Classes

Classes can implement interfaces to ensure that they adhere to the contract defined by the interface. This ensures that the class contains the required properties and methods.

### Syntax:

```typescript
interface InterfaceName {
  property1: type;
  method1(param: type): returnType;
}

class ClassName implements InterfaceName {
  // Implement required properties and methods
}
```

### Example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  greet(): void;
}

class Student implements Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  
  constructor(name: string, age: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}, and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const student = new Student("John", 20);
student.greet();  // Output: Hello, I am John, and I am 20 years old.
```

In this example, the `Student` class implements the `Person` interface and provides the required `name`, `age`, and `greet` method.

## 9. Interface with Index Signatures

You can use an index signature to define objects that can have dynamic property names.

### Syntax:

```typescript
interface Dictionary {
  [key: string]: number;  // A string index signature with number values
}
```

### Example:

```typescript
interface Dictionary {
  [key: string]: number;
}

const scores: Dictionary = {
  "Alice": 85,
  "Bob": 92
};

console.log(scores["Alice"]);  // Output: 85
```

In this example, the `Dictionary` interface defines an index signature that allows dynamic properties with `string` keys and `number` values.

## 10. Interface Merging

In TypeScript, if you declare an interface with the same name multiple times, the declarations are merged into a single interface. This is called **interface merging**.

### Example:

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Person {
  greet(): void;
}

const person: Person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};
```

In this example, the two `Person` interfaces are merged, meaning the resulting `Person` interface will have `name`, `age`, and `greet` properties.

## 11. Conclusion
