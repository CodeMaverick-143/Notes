# My Journey in Web Development and DSA - 01/01/2025

Today marks the first day of the year, and I am excited to continue my journey in web development. I spent the day learning about JavaScript, specifically focusing on concepts related to **DOM Manipulation**. 

I also completed some easy-level JavaScript exercises, which have helped me strengthen my understanding of fundamental web development concepts. This is an important step in boosting my web development and **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** foundation.

Looking forward to further progress as I build my skills in both web development and problem-solving.
