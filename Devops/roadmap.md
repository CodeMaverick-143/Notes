---

## 7. Monitoring and Logging
### Skills to Learn:
- Setting up systems to monitor performance and detect issues.

### Tools:
- **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**, **Datadog**, **Splunk**.

### Example:
- Setting up Grafana dashboards to monitor CPU and memory usage of servers.

### Case Study:
- A fintech company detects and resolves API bottlenecks using Prometheus alerts and Grafana dashboards.

---

## 8. Security (DevSecOps)
### Skills to Learn:
- Integrating security practices into the DevOps pipeline.

### Tools:
- **OWASP ZAP**, **Snyk**, **Aqua Security**, **HashiCorp Vault**.

### Example:
- Using Snyk to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities during CI/CD.

### Case Study:
- A SaaS provider avoids a major data breach by implementing security scans in its CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 9. Collaboration and Documentation
### Skills to Learn:
- Effective communication between teams and documenting workflows.

### Tools:
- **Slack**, **Confluence**, **Microsoft Teams**, **Jira**.

### Example:
- Using Jira for tracking user stories and sprints in Agile development.

### Case Study:
- A global development team improves productivity by adopting Jira for task management and Confluence for documentation.

---

## 10. Advanced Topics
### Skills to Learn:
- **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**: Automating reliability and ensuring system uptime.
- **Chaos Engineering**: Simulating failures to improve resilience.

### Tools:
- **Chaos Monkey**, **Gremlin** (for chaos engineering).
- **Terraform Cloud**, **Spinnaker** (for advanced deployment).

### Case Study:
- A streaming service uses Chaos Monkey to test and improve fault tolerance for peak traffic periods.
